# Zappy.sh - my personal URL shortner

### Motivation
I built this for fun to learn how to create my own REST APIs in Go and have a useful tool for myself

### Next steps
- gate the /requests endpoint
- create a CLI tool for me to quickly create zappies (aka url aliases)
- build a dashboard to visualize zaps (aka requests)
- build iOS keyboard plugin to create a zappy from chat
