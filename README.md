# Zappy.sh - my personal URL shortner

### [CLI Repo](https://github.com/yesh0907/zappy-cli)

### Motivation
I built this for fun to learn how to create my own REST APIs in Go and have a useful tool for myself

### Next steps
- ~~gate the /requests endpoint~~
- ~~create a CLI tool for me to quickly create zappies (aka url aliases)~~
- build a dashboard to visualize zaps (aka requests)
- build iOS keyboard plugin to create a zappy from chat
- group aliases together (e.g: aliases I use for my resume)
- create a user system to let others use this
- turn it into a simple SaaS
